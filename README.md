# 3d Spinning cube


Hey, I was a little bored so I made this little spinning cube in 3d with only rotation matrix multiplication, I also improved the depth effect with a Z average value that influence the darkness of each lines of the cube

You can read this [wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotation_matrix#In_three_dimensions) which is really interesting on this topic.
